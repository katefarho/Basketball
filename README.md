# Basketball
I included the following teams in this repository:
* Detroit Pistons
* Pheonix Suns
* LA Lakers
* New York Knicks
* Chicago Bulls
In the list I went through each of the teams rosters and chose random players to include in the text files. Before doing this assignment I didn't know how many crazy players the Lakers have, which is weird because they should be a lot better than they are. It was also funny to see how many players have switched teams since I was last really invested in the NBA. Instead of the NBA I prefer to watch college basketball especially when it's Michigan State.
